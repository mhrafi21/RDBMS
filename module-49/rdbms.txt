What is Anomalies?

Ans: Anomalies in database refer to inconsistencies or unexpected issues that can occur during data manipulation or retrieval.

There are three main types of anomalies. These are - 

1. Update anomalies.
2. Delete Anomalies.
3. Insert Anomalies.

We can remove anomalies using normalization.

Normalization- 
Functional Dependency(
    Functional Dependency in simple terms means that the value of one attribute (or set of attribute) uniquely determines the value of another attribute(s) in a database table

)
Normal Forms(
    A series of guidelines that help to ensure that the design of a database is efficient, organized, and free form data anomalies.
)
1NF has 6 rules. These are - 
1. Atomic Values.
2. Unique Column Names.
3. Positional Dependency of data.
4. Column should contain data that are of the same type.
5. Determine Primary key.

2NF Rules - 
Must be in 1NF,
Must not contain any non-prime/non-key attribute that is functionally dependent on a proper  subset of any candidate key of the relation.

3NF Rules - 
Must be 2NF 
Must not contain transitive Dependency
