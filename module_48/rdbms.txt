Anatomy of A Table Relation --
------------------------------------------
1. Firstly add entity- (if E-commerce need user, product, order, category etc.) We can represent it by using table.
Column is called Attribute.
Degree ( Collection of column);
Row is called Tuples/Records.
Cardinality (Collection of Row);

What is Key and Super Key?
------------------------------------------
Ans: A key in a relational database is a field or a combination of fields that uniquely identifiers a record in a table.

1. Super Key (
     - Attribute or set attribute by which we can identify each row uniquely. 
     - It could be single attribute or set of attribute, Could have null values in the set.
     -It actually superset
     ) ,
2. Candidate Key
(
    - Super key which proper subset is not a super key.
    - Also called Minimal Super key.
    - Potential Primary Key: From the candidate keys, one is chosen as the primary key. However, all candidate keys are potential choices for the primary key.
), 
3. Alternate Key,
4. Composite Key,
5. Primary Key,
6. Foreign Key,
